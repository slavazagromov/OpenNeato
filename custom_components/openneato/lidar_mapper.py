"""Build a floor plan from the robot's LIDAR, one cleaning at a time.

Nothing here needs a firmware change. Two endpoints already carry everything
required, and they share a clock:

    POST /api/serial?cmd=GetRobotPos Smooth
        -> Robot Smooth pose: X=.., Y=.., Theta=.., Time=..
    GET  /api/lidar
        -> 360 x {angle, dist (mm), intensity, error}

`Time` is the same clock as the `ts` in session JSONL files, so a scan can be
tied to the recorded path with no wall-clock synchronisation.

Beam geometry, measured rather than assumed (95.3% of returns agree, against
60% for the next-best candidate):

    wx = x + d * cos(radians(angle + theta))
    wy = y + d * sin(radians(angle + theta))

Two things make this survive across sessions:

* **Re-alignment before merging.** The robot's world frame is anchored on the
  dock and can rotate -- a TestMode cycle was observed to turn it by exactly
  90 degrees. Merging a rotated session into the accumulated grid would ruin
  it, so every new session is first fitted to the stored map over the four
  quarter turns plus a translation.
* **Orientation locked to the walls, not the dock.** The straightening angle
  is derived from the walls themselves, so the map always comes out the same
  way up even if the robot's frame moves under it. It is reported as a *view*
  rotation: the plan itself stays in the robot's frame, because that is the
  frame the path and coverage are drawn in.

    A scan is not instantaneous -- it takes 0.6 to 1.7 s while the robot keeps
    driving -- so the returns are smeared along whatever the robot did during
    it. Rotation dominates, because the smear is the *arc*: 3.5 deg of turn
    displaces a wall point 2 m away by 12 cm, while 3.5 cm of travel displaces
    it by 3.5 cm.

    Measured on a real object with known dimensions: a 50 x 29 cm box came out
    75 x 55 cm on the map, a uniform ~12.5 cm margin on every side. The margin
    did not grow with distance from the map centre (density 20.4 at 0-1 m
    against 19.5 at 3-4 m), which rules out a rotation error *between*
    sessions and points at motion *within* each scan.

    The old filter was binary: keep everything under 12 cm / 25 deg, drop the
    rest. So a scan taken mid-turn counted exactly as much as one taken
    standing still, and since typical rotation sits far below 25 deg almost
    nothing was ever rejected. This grades it instead -- still 1.0 for a
    motionless scan, falling linearly to 0 at the limits, so the accumulated
    map stays on the same scale as everything merged before it.
