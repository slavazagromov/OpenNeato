"""Drive LIDAR mapping across a cleaning run.

Watches the coordinator for the robot going out to clean, samples pose and
scan while it works, and folds the result into the accumulated map when it
docks. The map improves with every run instead of being rebuilt from one.

The polling budget is deliberately modest. Reading a scan holds the robot's
serial link for roughly 800 ms, and the firmware skips its own 2 s pose
snapshot while a fetch is in flight, so this watches the recording session
file's growth and backs off if the robot's own path log starts thinning.
Measured over a 49-minute run at a 4 s interval, that log stayed at 95-126%
of its normal rate.
