        over, so the event lands on a robot with nothing to return from and it
        simply sits there -- with, per docs/neato-serial-protocol.md, its
        localisation already discarded and its origin re-zeroed wherever it
        happened to be. Pressing "return to base" then looks broken.

        So when the robot is idle and off the dock, briefly restart cleaning
        to give the state machine a run to end, then send it home. The brush
        spins for a second or two on the way; that is the cost of the button
        doing what it says from any state.

        That recovery is not free: the protocol notes say a bare `Clean` also
        resets the robot's position, so the restart discards localisation just
        as Stop did. There is no lossless way home once a run has been
        stopped -- a robot that comes back beats a preserved frame, and the
        LIDAR mapper realigns the next session anyway. To keep localisation,
        **pause** instead of stopping, then return to base: from PAUSED this
        method sends the event straight through with no restart.
