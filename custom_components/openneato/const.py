# ── Floorplan background (history map camera) ──────────────────────────────
# When configured, the history/motion map renders a user-supplied house
# floorplan image as the background instead of the dark solid color. The
# robot's world coordinates (metres, robot odometry frame) are mapped onto
# the image via an origin (x,y metres), a rotation (degrees) and a scale
# (pixels per metre). All four are calibrated manually once.
# Below this much overlap between the plan and the cleaned area, the
# background is effectively invisible (blank image margin is what lands on
# the canvas). Warn with the numbers needed to fix the calibration rather
# than rendering a blank-looking map with nothing in the log.

# The firmware returns uiState as full enum strings like "UIMGR_STATE_HOUSECLEANINGRUNNING".
# We match using substrings (via .includes() style) like the frontend does in dashboard.tsx.
# These substring keys are checked against the raw uiState value.

    `GetErr` reports far more than faults. The firmware groups codes 201-242
    as `UI_ALERT_*` -- "informational", in its own words -- and tags them
    `kind: "warning"`; everything else is `kind: "error"`. Among those alerts
    are 201 `UI_ALERT_RETURN_TO_BASE` and 202 `..._PWR`, which the robot
    raises *every time it heads home at the end of a clean*, alongside
    "Cleaning complete", "Dust bin full" and "Recovering location".

    Reading `hasError` alone therefore painted a normal end-of-cycle dock as a
    fault: the vacuum entity flipped to ERROR and the problem sensor tripped,
    on every single run. Real failures still surface -- 252
    `UI_ERROR_UNABLE_TO_RETURN_TO_BASE` sits outside the alert range and keeps
    `kind: "error"`.

    Firmware predating the `kind` field falls back to the old behaviour rather
    than silently swallowing faults.
