/*
 * OpenNeato replay card
 *
 * Plays a cleaning session back on a canvas at display refresh rate, the way
 * the robot's own web UI does. The rendering is a port of
 * frontend/src/views/history/helpers.ts::renderMap and the playback loop is a
 * port of frontend/src/views/history/motion-player.tsx, so what you see here
 * and what you see at http://neato.local/#/history/... are the same picture.
 *
 * Session data arrives pre-parsed over the WebSocket connection
 * (openneato/sessions, openneato/session) — the browser only draws.

    // that sizes to its content, so asking for 100% of an auto height gives
    // back the content height. Styling those wrappers from the dashboard does
    // not work either, because `stack-in-card` renders its children through a
    // `hui-vertical-stack-card` and CSS does not cross shadow boundaries.
    //
    // Setting flex on the immediate parent alone -- what this used to do --
    // is not enough. Measured on a real dashboard, the chain above the card
    // was hui-card, div, hui-vertical-stack-card, div, ha-card, stack-in-card,
    // hui-card. The plain `div` sits at `display: block` and `stack-in-card`
    // at `display: inline`, so either one stops a flex chain dead: the card
    // stayed at its 220px minimum inside a 901px column.
    //
    // It looked intermittent because it depends on the neighbouring columns.
    // When they render short the row is short too and 322px fills it, so the
    // card looks right; when they render tall the card stays 322px and looks
    // stranded. Same bug either way.
    //
    // So walk up instead, crossing shadow roots by hand -- `parentElement` is
    // null at a shadow boundary, the way out is `parentNode.host` -- and make
    // each ancestor a flex column until reaching one with real slack. Bounded
    // to a few hops so a different dashboard layout cannot send it climbing
    // to `<body>`.
    // ⚠ Deciding where to stop by comparing heights only works once the
    // dashboard has actually been laid out, and at connect time the
    // neighbouring columns have not rendered. Firing on a timer to wait for
    // them is a race, and it is the race that made this look like it happened
    // "one time in two": on a warm cache the page paints before the timer, on
    // a cold one after. So the chain is (re)built from a ResizeObserver on the
    // column instead of from a clock -- see _observeStretch.
    // ⚠ Never restyle these. The walk below sets `display: flex` as it climbs,
    // and `flex` overrides `grid` -- so reaching the dashboard's own layout
    // container replaces its `grid-template-columns` with a single flex column
    // and collapses the whole page into one column. That is not theoretical:
    // it happened on this dashboard, and it was the real cause of all three

    // Two things have to be true for this to read as a grid of squares, and
    // getting either wrong is what produced the earlier messes:
    //
    // 1. The lattice must be applied *after* every transform. The card
    //    rescales the plan by a fractional factor and turns it a couple of
    //    degrees to straighten it against the walls, and either operation
    //    resamples a lattice baked into the PNG into ragged clumps — squares
    //    come out as L-shapes and pairs weld together.
    // 2. Each square must take a single colour. Masking the drawn plan
    //    through a lattice is not enough: the wall cells underneath do not
    //    line up with it, so one square can straddle a wall edge and come out
    //    part black, part blue. So every square is resolved to one of the
    //    three states and filled flat.
    //
    // Walls win a square they only partly cover. They are the thin feature
    // here, and letting the floor take those squares eats holes in them.

    // one pass per zoom or pan rather than one per frame.

// add_extra_js_url on its own loses the race against the dashboard's first
// render. So the registration has to survive being run twice.
//
// Always *attempt* the define and swallow the duplicate-name error, rather
// than skipping the define when customElements.get() reports the name is
// taken. Guarding on get() was observed leaving the element unregistered
// while the rest of this block had plainly run -- and a card that is loaded
// but not registered is exactly the "Custom element doesn't exist" error the
// dashboard shows. Attempting unconditionally has no such failure mode: the
// only way to end up unregistered is for define() itself to throw, which it
// only does when the name is already taken.
