"""Session parsing for the interactive replay card.

Direct port of `frontend/src/history-data.ts::buildSession`, with two
differences the canvas player depends on:

  * pose timestamps are normalised against the first retained pose, so the
    scrubber's 0 lines up with the summary duration;
  * recharge markers (which carry no `ts` of their own) are paired with the
    long gaps in the pose timeline, giving each one a start/end window for
    the scrubber's charge segments.

Output is deliberately compact -- flat number arrays instead of dicts, and
coordinates rounded -- because a full session ships over the WebSocket
connection to the browser.
