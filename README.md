# OpenNeato — Home Assistant and active no-go fork

This repository combines two OpenNeato code lines into one project:

1. [renjfk/OpenNeato](https://github.com/renjfk/OpenNeato), which supplies the ESP32 robot bridge, local web
   interface, firmware, and flash tool; and
2. the Home Assistant-focused [Leicas/OpenNeato](https://github.com/Leicas/OpenNeato) fork, including the
   HACS integration under [`custom_components/openneato/`](custom_components/openneato/).

The combined project adds an active no-go guard, Home Assistant map editor, robot-side enforcement, status
telemetry, and a stationary hardware test panel. The custom no-go implementation and integration glue were
read, reviewed, and rewritten by **OpenAI Codex**, working with the repository owner. This statement applies
to this fork's custom work; the original upstream projects retain their own authorship and licenses.

> [!WARNING]
> **Hardware validation is pending.** Firmware `1.24.0-nogo.6-physical-test1` builds successfully, but the
> four-channel PhotoMOS wiring and moving no-go response have not yet completed on-robot validation. Treat
> this branch as experimental. Never use a software no-go line as the only protection at stairs or another
> fall hazard.

## Four-channel physical bumper interface

The original ESP32 WROOM32 build drives four normally-open Omron G3VM-61A1 PhotoMOS relays. Each relay input
is wired from its ESP32 GPIO through a **330 ohm series resistor**, with pin 2 returning to any ESP32 GND.
The isolated relay output (pins 3 and 4, no polarity) is placed in parallel with the corresponding Neato
bumper/whisker switch. A 300 ms pulse therefore looks like a real bumper hit to the robot's native cleaner.

Directions below are from the robot's perspective while driving forward:

| Robot contact | ESP32 GPIO | PhotoMOS input wiring | Robot sensor bit |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Left outer whisker | 25 | GPIO25 → 330 Ω → pin 1; pin 2 → GND | `lSideBit` |
| Left inner/front bumper | 26 | GPIO26 → 330 Ω → pin 1; pin 2 → GND | `lFrontBit` |
| Right inner/front bumper | 27 | GPIO27 → 330 Ω → pin 1; pin 2 → GND | `rFrontBit` |
| Right outer whisker | 14 | GPIO14 → 330 Ω → pin 1; pin 2 → GND | `rSideBit` |

For full behavior, API endpoints, safeguards, and the test sequence, see
[`docs/nogo-guard.md`](docs/nogo-guard.md). Test each channel while the robot is charged, idle, and docked via
**Settings → Diagnostics → Physical bumper wiring** before attempting a moving no-go test.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **If you want the stable standalone web UI without this experimental hardware**, use upstream
> [renjfk/OpenNeato](https://github.com/renjfk/OpenNeato) directly — it has the original maintainer, release
> cadence, and live demo.
>
> **Use this fork if** you run Home Assistant and want the robot exposed as a first-class HA device, or if you
> are helping validate the active no-go guard and four-channel physical bumper interface.

The upstream project is an open-source replacement for Neato's discontinued cloud and mobile app: an ESP32
bridge that talks to Botvac robots (D3-D7) over UART and exposes a local web UI over WiFi — no cloud, no app,
no account required.

> [!NOTE]
> Both upstream and this fork are early beta. Rough edges are expected. For changes specific to this combined
> fork, open an [issue here](https://github.com/slavazagromov/OpenNeato/issues). For an unmodified upstream
> firmware/frontend/flash-tool bug, file against [renjfk/OpenNeato](https://github.com/renjfk/OpenNeato/issues).

> [!TIP]
> Want to get a feel for the underlying web UI without hardware? Open the upstream
> [live demo](https://openneato-demo.renjfk.com/). Demo states can be selected with `?scenario=...`; see
> [mock scenarios](docs/mock-scenarios.md).

## About the underlying project (upstream)

The sections below describe the upstream [renjfk/OpenNeato](https://github.com/renjfk/OpenNeato) project that
this fork builds on — the ESP32 bridge firmware, standalone web UI, and flash tool. **None of this is unique
to this fork**; it's reproduced here so HA users have full context on what's running behind the integration.
If you only want the HA bits, you can skip ahead to the [Home Assistant section](#home-assistant-integration)
below.

Neato shut down their cloud services and mobile app, leaving perfectly functional robot vacuums without remote
control or scheduling. OpenNeato brings them back to life with a small ESP32 board wired to the robot's debug
port, giving you a local web interface that works without any external dependencies.

### Upstream web UI features

- **Dashboard** with live robot status, battery level, cleaning state, WiFi signal, and storage usage
- **House and spot cleaning** with pause/resume/stop/dock controls that adapt to the current state
- **Manual driving mode** with a virtual joystick, live LIDAR map visualization, motor toggles (brush, vacuum, side
  brush), bumper/wheel-lift/stall safety warnings
- **Live cleaning map** — watch the robot's path during an active cleaning session in the History view, rendered on a
  canvas with coverage overlay
- **7-day cleaning scheduler** with two slots per day, managed entirely on the ESP32 (doesn't use the robot's built-in
  schedule commands)
- **Cleaning history** with recorded robot paths rendered as coverage maps, session stats like duration, distance, area
  covered, and battery usage; individual session import/export for backup and restore
- **Push notifications** via [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh); get notified when cleaning is done, an error occurs, a
  maintenance alert triggers, or the robot docks; fully optional, configurable per event
- **OTA firmware updates** from the browser with SHA-256 download verification (against published `checksums.txt`), MD5
  transfer integrity, dual-partition layout with auto-rollback, and automatic new version notifications when a release
  is available on GitHub
- **Settings page** for hostname, timezone, motor presets, notification topics, UART pins, theme (dark/light/auto),
  battery diagnostics (cycle count, voltage, temperature, and a "New Battery" calibration trigger), and more
- **Event logging** with configurable log levels (off/info/debug), compressed JSONL files on SPIFFS, browsable and
  downloadable from the UI; optional remote syslog (UDP) for long-running diagnostics without flash wear; logging is
  off by default
- **Factory reset** via 5-second button hold on the ESP32 or from the settings page
- **Robot clock sync** — pushes NTP time to the robot automatically, re-syncs every 4 hours
- **Flash tool** — standalone CLI that auto-detects the USB port, downloads the correct firmware from GitHub Releases,
  and flashes with zero prerequisites
- **Safety watchdog** — auto-stops wheels in manual mode if the browser disconnects; task and heap watchdogs restart the
  ESP32 on hangs
- **Crash recovery** — orphaned cleaning sessions after unexpected reboots are automatically recovered with full stats

The frontend is a lightweight SPA that gets gzipped and embedded directly into the firmware binary, so a single
OTA update covers both firmware and UI. Mobile-friendly, dark theme by default.

## Home Assistant Integration

This fork ships a HACS-installable Home Assistant custom integration in
[`custom_components/openneato/`](custom_components/openneato/). Once installed it discovers your OpenNeato bridge
by IP/hostname and exposes the robot as a full HA device — no YAML, no extra add-ons.

> [!NOTE]
> The HA integration is the primary differentiator of this fork. The firmware, frontend, and flash tool track
> upstream [`renjfk/OpenNeato`](https://github.com/renjfk/OpenNeato) closely. If you only want the standalone web
> UI, use upstream directly.

### Home Assistant no-go workflow

Home Assistant is not merely displaying the robot in this fork. The custom
integration provides the map editor and sends the saved geometry to the ESP32:

1. Add `type: custom:openneato-replay-card` to a Lovelace dashboard. SkyDash
   uses one replay card for each robot on its **Vacuums** tab, alongside the
   vacuum controls, schedule, notifications, Wi-Fi/error status, last-clean
   statistics, maintenance buttons, and robot web-interface link.
2. In the replay card, select a completed cleaning session whose floor plan
   aligns with the room, then click **No-go lines**.
3. Tap the map to place at least two points. Use **New line** for another
   barrier and **Undo** to correct a point.
4. Set **Guard on**, then click **Save**. Older passive builds called this
   control **Observer on**; the active implementation deliberately calls it
   **Guard on** because it now causes a physical avoidance response.
5. A successful save reports `N line(s) armed for enforcement`. The integration
   transforms the card coordinates into the robot's dock-relative frame and
   sends the reference session, 0.20 m warning distance, enabled state, and
   line geometry to the ESP32. The ESP32 validates and persists it in
   `/nogo.json`, so enforcement does not depend on the dashboard remaining
   open.

The HA entity ID retains the older word for compatibility:
`binary_sensor.<robot>_no_go_observer_armed`. Its displayed name is **No-go
guard armed**. The integration also exposes **Near no-go line**, **No-go line
breached**, line distance, guard stage, last action/result, near/breach counts,
completed escapes, and failed-step counts. It fires `openneato_nogo_near` and
`openneato_nogo_breached` events on new transitions.

During a fallback maneuver, the integration keeps the vacuum entity in
`cleaning` state while the firmware briefly pauses, enters TestMode, reverses,
turns, resumes, and cools down. This prevents Home Assistant automations from
mistaking one avoidance maneuver for a stopped and newly started cleaning run.

> [!NOTE]
> If the replay card says **No-go unavailable**, Home Assistant is installed but
> the connected robot does not expose the matching `/api/nogo/*` firmware
> endpoints. Both the integration from this branch and the combined robot
> firmware must be installed.

### Install via HACS

1. In HACS, add this fork as a **custom repository**: `https://github.com/slavazagromov/OpenNeato` (category:
   *Integration*).
2. Search for **OpenNeato** in HACS and install.
3. Restart Home Assistant.
4. **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → OpenNeato** and enter the bridge hostname or IP
   (e.g. `neato.local` or `192.168.1.42`).

The integration polls `/api/*` over your LAN every 5 seconds (`local_polling`). No cloud round-trip, no
external dependencies. Requires firmware `1.0+`; battery diagnostics need firmware `0.13+` (upstream PR #121).

### What you get

A single device with the following entity groups:

- **Vacuum** (`vacuum.openneato_<name>`) — start/stop/pause/dock/locate/spot-clean, battery level, status,
  fan speed presets (Eco/Auto/Intense), error reporting. Works with all the standard vacuum cards.
- **Map card** — [`openneato-replay-card`](custom_components/openneato/www/openneato-replay-card.js), a
  canvas Lovelace card that draws the accumulated LIDAR floorplan and replays a cleaning session over it,
  with pan, zoom, a timeline scrubber, and the active no-go editor. It reads the `openneato/session`,
  `openneato/sessions`, `openneato/nogo_get`, and `openneato/nogo_set` websocket commands directly. It
  replaces the former `LIDAR map` and `Cleaning replay` camera entities, which are gone.
- **Sensors** — battery level/voltage/current/temperature, battery cycle count, cumulative cleaning time,
  WiFi RSSI, free heap, storage used, uptime, motor RPMs, error code/message, plus "last clean" stats
  (duration, area covered, distance, battery used, mode, end time) pulled from the on-device history.
- **Binary sensors** — charging, external power, battery over-temp, battery failure, empty fuel, error
  active, NTP synced, dustbin seated, left/right wheel lifted, DC jack, and the six bumper contacts
  (front/side/LDS, left and right — disabled by default, since they toggle on every bump), plus no-go guard
  armed, near-line, and breached states.
- **Switches** — eco mode, intense clean, bin-full detect, wall follower, schedule on/off, button-click
  sounds, melodies, warnings, stealth LED, remote syslog, WiFi AP fallback, and per-event push
  notifications (start/done/error/alert/docking).
- **Text** — syslog server IP, ntfy topic, ntfy server, ntfy token (full push-notification config from HA).
- **Numbers** — brush RPM, vacuum speed, side-brush power, stall threshold.
- **Select** — navigation mode (Normal / Gentle / Deep / Quick).
- **Buttons** — restart bridge, restart robot, shutdown robot, locate, clear errors, format filesystem
  (diagnostic, disabled by default), **new battery** (resets fuel-gauge calibration after a physical pack
  swap, disabled by default for safety).

Every entity is translated via `strings.json`, and diagnostic-class entities (voltages, currents, raw
sensor states) are tagged so they cluster cleanly under HA's Diagnostic section.

### Notes for setup

- **The map card needs no installation** — the integration serves
  `www/openneato-replay-card.js` itself and registers the script tag, so there is nothing to copy into
  `/config/www/` and no Lovelace resource to add. Just add a manual card with
  `type: custom:openneato-replay-card`. The browser cache is keyed on the integration version, so the
  card refreshes on upgrade rather than needing a hard reload. The walls come from the integration's own
  LIDAR mapper, which accumulates an occupancy grid across cleanings — the plan sharpens with each run.
- **Reading the diagnostics** — two field names are misleading and the integration corrects for them:
  `errorCode` returns **200** (`UI_ALERT_INVALID`) when nothing is wrong, so the *Error code* sensor
  reports *unknown* instead; and `chargerMAH` / `dischargeMAH` are **milliamps, not milliamp-hours**
  (measured decreasing while the robot discharged), so they are exposed with a current device class.
  `dcJackIn` is the robot's own barrel jack, not the dock — *on dock* is `extPwrPresent`.
- **Coordinator resilience** — the integration tolerates a single hung endpoint without going into
  "requires attention" state. State / charger / system are critical; anything else (errors, motors,
  history) falls back to the last known value during transient ESP32 serial hangs.
- **No Pillow declared dependency** — the LIDAR mapper writes its wall grid with Pillow, which already
  ships with HA Core, so the integration's `manifest.json` keeps `"requirements": []`. Nothing extra to
  install.
- **ntfy + custom servers** — point `ntfy_server` at a self-hosted instance and `ntfy_token` at a Bearer
  token for authenticated push. Empty server defaults to `ntfy.sh`; empty token is unauthenticated.

### Version history

Full per-version notes live in [`custom_components/openneato/CHANGELOG.md`](custom_components/openneato/CHANGELOG.md).
Highlights:

- **Current physical test branch** — active no-go status and events; replay-card guard editor; map/robot
  coordinate translation; physical-bumper-first avoidance with the direct TestMode escape retained as
  fallback; HA vacuum state stays continuously `cleaning` through an avoidance maneuver.

- **1.12** — the `openneato-replay-card` canvas card replaces the `LIDAR map` and `Cleaning replay`
  cameras (`Platform.CAMERA` dropped); self-calibrating LIDAR floorplan with per-session alignment;
  HA-settable 7-day schedule (14 `time` entities + 14 slot switches); six bumper binary sensors, off by
  default; `chargerMAH` / `dischargeMAH` corrected from mAh to mA; the `errorCode` 200 sentinel no longer
  reported as an error; `Dock contact` renamed `DC jack`; static floorplan-background option removed.
- **1.11** — added `notify_on_start` and `ap_fallback_on_disconnect` switches; ntfy topic/server/token text
  entities for full HA-side push config.
- **1.10** — battery diagnostics (current, voltage, cycles, cumulative cleaning time) on top of firmware
  PR #121, `New battery` calibration button, UTF-8-tolerant `/api/version` parsing.
- **1.9** — fixed cameras stuck on the idle placeholder (`get_encoding()` crash on streamed bodies).
- **1.6** — `Cleaning replay` camera (animated GIF time-lapse), `/api/history` corruption-tolerant parsing,
  history filename validation + 2 MB response cap (LAN-MITM mitigation).
- **1.3** — `LIDAR map` camera ported from the frontend renderer; self-managed polling.
- **1.2** — last-clean stats sensors; dropped Pillow from declared deps.
