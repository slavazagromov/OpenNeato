# Manual Release Process Guide

This document describes the step-by-step manual release process for OpenNeato using AI assistance to analyze commits, generate release notes, trigger the GitHub Actions workflow, and roll over release milestones via opencode (with `gh` CLI integration).

## Overview

The manual release process involves:

1. **AI-driven commit analysis** - Analyze commit history since last release
2. **AI-generated release notes** following strict formatting conventions
3. **Preview and review** - release notes shown before any actions taken
4. **Human review and approval** for quality control
5. **Workflow dispatch** - trigger GitHub Actions via `gh` CLI
6. **Automated build and release** - workflow builds frontend, firmware, flash tool and publishes GitHub Release
7. **Milestone rollover** - close the released milestone and create the next minor milestone

## Prerequisites

- [opencode](https://opencode.ai/) installed
- [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com) installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`)
- Understanding of conventional commit patterns
- Familiarity with major.minor versioning (no patch versions)

## AI-Assisted Release Process

Use this prompt in opencode to handle the entire release process:

### Master Release Prompt

```
I need to create a new release for OpenNeato. Please:

STEP 1: ANALYZE COMMITS
- Use `gh` CLI or available tools to get the latest release tag
- Fetch all commits between that tag and current HEAD
- Analyze each commit for user-facing changes
- Resolve the GitHub username for each externally authored user-facing change from its commit or merged PR

STEP 2: GENERATE RELEASE NOTES
Create structured release notes with this EXACT format:

### Breaking Changes
[Only if breaking changes exist - triggers major version]
- Description focusing on user impact (abc1234 [by @external-author])

### New Features
- Feature description emphasizing user benefit (abc1234 [by @external-author])

### Improvements
- Improvement description with user impact (abc1234 [by @external-author])

### Bug Fixes
- Fix description focusing on resolved user issue (abc1234 [by @external-author])

REQUIREMENTS:
- Focus ONLY on user-facing changes and impact
- EXCLUDE: docs, build, ci, chore, refactor, test commits
- Use active voice, present tense
- Include commit short hashes and format externally authored changes as `abc1234 by @username` (GitHub renders both as links)
- Closely related changes may be collapsed into one bullet; retain a separate `commit by @username` attribution for each external author
- Version logic: major.minor format only (no patch)
  - MINOR version (1.0 → 1.1): New features, bug fixes, improvements
  - MAJOR version (1.1 → 2.0): Breaking changes detected
- Do not add a separate Contributors section; credit external authors inline and omit the repository owner
- Show this preview BEFORE any actions

STEP 3: SHOW PREVIEW
Display the generated release notes and ask for approval before proceeding.

STEP 4: TRIGGER WORKFLOW (after approval)
Use `gh workflow run` to trigger the "Build and Release" workflow:

```bash
gh workflow run release.yml \
  -f release_tag="v[VERSION]" \
  -f release_notes="[generated content]" \
  -f draft=true \
  -f prerelease=false
```

STEP 5: ROLL OVER MILESTONE (after the workflow succeeds)
- Wait for the release workflow to complete successfully
- List all milestones and find the open milestone matching the release tag
- Verify that the next minor milestone does not already exist
- Close the released milestone and create the next minor milestone

```bash
gh api --paginate 'repos/{owner}/{repo}/milestones?state=all' \
  --jq '.[] | [.number, .title, .state] | @tsv'
gh api --method PATCH 'repos/{owner}/{repo}/milestones/[MILESTONE_NUMBER]' \
  -f state=closed
gh api --method POST 'repos/{owner}/{repo}/milestones' \
  -f title='v[NEXT_VERSION]'
```

Please start with Step 1 - analyze the commits and show me the preview.
```

## How It Works

opencode will:
1. **Analyze commits** since last release via `gh` CLI
2. **Generate release notes** with proper formatting, categorization, and inline external-author shoutouts
3. **Show preview** and ask for approval
4. **Trigger GitHub Actions workflow** with the release notes
5. The workflow **builds frontend** (npm), **builds firmware** (PlatformIO), then **GoReleaser** builds cross-platform flash tool binaries and publishes the GitHub Release with firmware packs attached
6. After the workflow succeeds, **close the released milestone** and **create the next minor milestone**

## Features

- **Automatic filtering** of technical commits (docs, tests, CI, etc.)
- **User-focused** release notes with clear impact descriptions
- **Smart versioning** - minor for features/fixes, major for breaking changes
- **Inline contributor recognition** - externally authored changes credit their authors
- **Preview before action** - human approval required
- **Full build pipeline** - frontend, firmware, and flash tool all built in one workflow
- **Milestone rollover** - completed releases close their milestone and open the next minor milestone

## Prereleases

Prereleases let you build and publish full release artifacts from a PR or branch for testing before merging or releasing.

### Triggering

**From the PR page:** Comment `/prerelease` on the PR. Only repository collaborators (OWNER, MEMBER, COLLABORATOR) can trigger this.

**From the CLI:**
```bash
gh workflow run prerelease.yml -f pr_number=<pr-number>
```

For a branch-only prerelease, omit `pr_number` and choose the branch ref:

```bash
gh workflow run prerelease.yml -r <branch-name>
```

### How it works

1. If `pr_number` is provided, resolves the PR head branch and commit
2. If `pr_number` is omitted, uses the workflow ref as a branch-only prerelease source
3. Computes a tag based on the latest release: `v<base>-pr<number>.<sha>` for PRs or `v<base>-<branch>.<sha>` for branches
4. Builds frontend, firmware, and flash tool
5. Publishes a GitHub prerelease via GoReleaser
6. Posts a comment on the PR with the release link when triggered via `/prerelease`

### Notes

- No CI gate - trigger whenever you want a test build
- Previous prereleases are not automatically cleaned up; remove stale PR or branch prereleases manually when needed
- The base version comes from the latest non-prerelease GitHub release (falls back to `v0.0`)
- A prerelease is stale when its PR is merged or closed, its PR head SHA no longer matches, or a branch prerelease has been superseded by a later stable release

## Troubleshooting

- **gh CLI issues**: Run `gh auth status` to verify authentication
- **Workflow dispatch failed**: Check repository permissions for workflow dispatch
- **Milestone rollover failed**: Verify the released milestone exists, the next milestone does not, and your token has issue write permission
- **Invalid release notes**: Review format requirements and regenerate
- **PlatformIO build fails**: Ensure `c3-release` environment builds locally first
- **Frontend build fails**: Run `npm run build` in `frontend/` locally to verify
